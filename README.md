# PHP-Tip-Calculator

This is a tip calculator made in PHP. The user enters an amount, and the user has the option to tip 10, 15, or 20 %.
The user is show the tip and the sum of the bill plus the tip.
Since I was informed of the CodePath Security bootcamp recently, I did not have much time for more enhancements.
